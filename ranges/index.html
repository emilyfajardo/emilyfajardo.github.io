<h1>Boxed Up</h1>
<p>
	Boxed Up is a san serif type face that is composed of rectangles and triangles. This typeface should mostly be used for headings or titles. When making this font I tried to incorperate the triangles as well as I could. I did not want the triangles to exist as a decorative element, rather to serve purpose to the letters, helping the legibility. This font is a blocky text that is bold and grabs attention. Using this font would make it the first thing the eye was drawn to being how heavy it is.
